# Projlette API
Users can submit their own challenges to the Projlette API.
But you must review the submitted problems before accepting them.

When accepted, a problem must be manually moved from the `preview-problems.json` file to the `problems.json` file, and restart the server.
After that, the problem will be available for users to solve.
